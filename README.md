# Project ShareMyLife

- This project was done in the first week of 2018 Winter-CS496(몰입캠프) course at KAIST with [@hyeyoung0112](https://github.com/hyeyoung0112).   

## 1. Introduction
- The project's goal was to be familiar with application development and collaboration in 몰입캠프. 

## 2. Description
- There are four tabs: (1) Phone book, (2) Gallery, (3) Upload photos to SNS
- Although the additional functions could be implemented freely, the first and second tabs were mandatory.
- The third tab was freely selected topic.
  - I chose to implement uploading photos to SNS because linking android application with SNS seems fun.
